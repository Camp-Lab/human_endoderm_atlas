Scripts for analysis and visualization of the manuscript "Charting human development using a multi-endodermal organ atlas and organoid models".

Following analyses are included:
1. Cellular heterogeneity analysis of the developing human multi-organ cell atlas;
2. Infere organ identity of organoid by projecting organoid data to developing atlas and kNN search;
3. Resolve heterogeneity of stem cell pools of different organs;
4. Characterize cell state transition of intestinal stem cells;
5. Reconstruction of regulon with pySCENIC.
